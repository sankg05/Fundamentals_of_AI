You are given two jugs, a 4-gallon one and a 3-gallon one. Neither has any measuring markers on it.   
There is a pump that can be used to fill the jugs with water.  How can you get exactly 2 gallons of water into the 4-gallon jug?

1- Define Task Environment for the water jug agent
2- Formulate the problem precisely, making only those distinctions necessary to ensure a valid solution. Draw a diagram of the complete state space.
3- Implement and solve the problem using  DFS search algorithms. 
4- Analyze the performance against Time, Space complexity. Show the intermediate status of OPEN and Close
