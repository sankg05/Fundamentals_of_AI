The problem statement is as follows:
a. Formulate the problem precisely, making only those distinctions necessary to ensure a valid solution. Draw a diagram of the PARTIAL state space.
b. Implement and solve the problem using an Uninformed search strategy. BFS  
c-Compare both search strategies against evaluation criteria

1-Completeness: by displaying the path to the solution 
2-Optimal: Display depth of the goal 
3-Time complexity: total no of nodes expanded. Size of the closed list 
4-Space Complexity: total no of nodes generated. Size of open list
